Clowder Space is a global place for sharing knowledge presented by open source contributors and users at online or face-to-face meetups.

In Clowder Space you will find previous or future Open Source project's events and talks related to Data Analytics and Cloud Native which you can add to your calendar.

Clowder Space also allows us to get in touch with the speakers and gurus in the different Open Source projects.

We are a space created by the community for the community, backed by organizations interested in supporting the Open Source community. 

This is a Beta version of Clowder space, so all your suggestions are welcome at info@clowder.space 

If you are interested in publishing your event, share the information with us and we will gladly help you: https://clowder.space/host-meetup/ 

Or if you want to participate as a speaker in one of the current projects events, just fill out the form located at each project page.
