Clowder Space is a repository of events (and their content) from open source projects. While large scale conferences usually have their own space for this purpose, smaller events (for example meetups) or communities rarely have that. On the other hand, services like meetup.com may be useful for RSVPing but are not very useful for managing the content generated in those meetups.
