Join us for an enlightening meetup where we delve deep into runtime security for applications and workloads running in Kubernetes. Our special guest, Hannes from Bifrost Security, will guide us on the tools and strategies to effectively protect your workloads. Following him, Jesper Larsson, an experienced pentester, will provide insights on how attackers view unprotected systems and exploit vulnerabilities. This is a unique opportunity to learn from experts in the field and enhance your security posture. Don't miss out on this chance to fortify your Kubernetes environments! Please RSVP to secure your spot and join us in making our community stronger!

### Runtime security - Confining Containers by behavior to keep them from going rouge ###
With development velocity accelerating further and security teams being overwhelmed,  “Shift left” in not enough secure workloads. Let’s see how we can strengthen the Defense in Depth without sacrificing speed. We’ll look at how runtime profiling can automatically learn “good” application behavior, how we can use Linux Security Modules (LSM) and to confine workload behavior, how they differ from each other, and how you can use them to confine workload behavior, to provide a strong first level of security for workloads.

### Your Pipeline Is My Playground – Real-World CI/CD and GitOps Security Gone Wrong ###
Your pipeline might be doing more than building code. I'll share real stories of how misconfigured GitHub Actions, GitLab pipelines, and GitOps workflows can open the door from a harmless build job to full cluster compromise. We'll look at how automation can turn into exploitation and how to make sure your pipelines aren't doing side gigs for attackers.
