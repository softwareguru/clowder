### LiftHub: A Secure, Self-Service, Cloud Native Developer Platform
by Aegide Steyaert and Vitalie Calmic, Cloud engineers at Devoteam

How do you empower developers with self-service tools while maintaining strict security? This session showcases LiftHub, a cloud-native application platform built at Devoteam, which successfully balances developer autonomy with robust control. We'll explore our use of CNCF tools like FluxCD and Kyverno before diving into security. Discover our practical implementation of Cosign for supply chain integrity—a crucial control for NIS2 compliance.



### Secure Access Made Simple: Ephemeral Postgres Credentials with Vault & Boundary
by Joeri Temmerman, Open Source Consultant (DevOps, Cloud Engineering, Linux)


Joeri has been managing cloud infrastructure for one of Belgium’s government institutions for the past six years, focusing on secure, scalable, and open-source solutions.

Managing database credentials securely is a challenge, especially when both developers and applications need access without long-lived secrets.

In this talk, Joeri will walk through how his team implemented ephemeral PostgreSQL credentials using Vault, Boundary, and Terraform to enable short-lived, auditable, and developer-friendly access.

Expect a practical demo with Minikube showing how this works for both applications and developers—plus lessons learned from running it in production for a major government environment.
