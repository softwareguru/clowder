The Open Source Analytics Conference happened last November 19th to 21st where participants got the chance to explore the most recent information in data ingestion, orchestration, databases, infrastructure, governance, visualization, and AI. 

Bringing together over 1,900 participants, OSA Con offered a diversity of sessions, interactive features, and global community engagement. 50 speakers pushed the boundaries of what is possible with open source based on their experience, professional development, and personal use cases. They mostly shared how to use different tools and methodologies such as Apache Airflow, GenAI, Lakehouse, DuckDB, and many more. 

During the 3 days of OSA Con, many community collaborators such as Altinity, Preset, and VictoriaMetrics contributed to the success of the conference. Robert Hodges, Maxime Beauchemin, and Aliaksandr Valialkin covered topics that included the Food Truck Metaphor, The Good, the Bad, and the Overhyped of AI, and how Kubernetes has changed everything.

OSA Con is not just another conference, it is an opportunity to learn about the latest trends in open source analytics from industry leaders while connecting with the whole community.  Open source allows users to redistribute copies of modified versions to others which benefits the whole community. It serves as a hub that provides platforms where individuals or organizations can share knowledge and spark innovation while collaborating without borders. It also ensures resilience in a rapidly evolving data landscape. 

This conference wouldn't have been possible without the incredible audience whose energy, support, and curiosity for Open-Source Analytics made it a success.
