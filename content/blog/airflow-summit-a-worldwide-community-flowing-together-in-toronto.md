Clayton Coleman, representing Google, delivered an engaging presentation titled "AI/ML's Impact on Orchestration: Leveraging Kubernetes to Enhance Airflow." In this talk he explained the role of Kubernetes in various ecosystems such as Apache Airflow.

The panel discussion titled "The Future of Airflow: What Users Want," featuring Jarek Potiuk, Viraj Parekh, Rafal Biegacz, and John Jackson, provided valuable insights. They discussed the key features that offer the most significant benefits to Airflow users. Jonathan Talmi presented “Manifest destiny: Orchestrating dbt using Airflow”, in this talk, he explained several ways of orchestrating dbt and showed the disadvantages of using one method over the other.

The Summit's final day offered attendees the opportunity to participate in various workshops, each led by Apache Airflow experts. The sponsor booths by Google, AWS, IBM, Preset, Qbiz, BMC, Astronomer, and Snowflake delved into discussions about how these technologies can streamline Airflow management.
