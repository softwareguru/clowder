Beam College 2024 was a success featuring 12 sessions with participants from 57 countries, over 200 organizations, and from a wide range of data and software related roles. Approximately 40% of the attendees were new to data processing and ready to learn new tools as well as key insights on the different levels of Apache Beam. Participants from different types of industries came together to improve their data processing skills and discuss new perspectives with the community. 

The beginner's track provided an overview of Apache Beam, covering key concepts such as its single programming model that handles both batch and streaming processing. Participants also learned about Project Shield, a free service powered by Apache Beam that helps protect websites from DDoS attacks, and Beam YAML, a new SDK that enables the creation of Beam pipelines using configuration files.

On the second day, attendees learned to implement an intermediate level machine learning pipeline using Apache Beam. They also  explored collaborative techniques with Apache Beam and AI tools, including a demo on using RunInference from a notebook in Google Colab. 

The final day was full of advanced training featured sessions on the differences between batch and streaming pipelines, along with practical demos about different types of dataflow templates, including classic and flex, with step-by-step demonstrations.

By registering to Beam College you could also have access to Beam Quest, an online course that includes a series of laboratory practices on Apache Beam and earn a certification badge at no cost. We can't wait to see how you've taken advantage of this incredible opportunity to deepen your knowledge of Apache Beam and how you'll incorporate it into your daily routine.

Thank you again everyone for participating, the energy and feedback were spot on and we canâ€™t wait to see how you will apply your new knowledge into the real world. For those who missed out, stay tuned for announcements on the recorded sessions and know that you can still access them.

Until next time!
