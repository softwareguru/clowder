The screen lights came on worldwide on November 4–5 as the open-source analytics community from every time zone gathered virtually in one place: OSA CON 2025. 

Over two days, participants tuned in, networked in virtual lounges, clicked into breakout chats, and clicked back into talks that ranged from high-velocity streaming analytics to the future of conversational data systems. The vibe: global, inclusive, forward-thinking.

Across keynotes and sessions, the idea emerged again and again: analytics is evolving. In one moment you’d be hearing about how real-time OLAP is now powering conversational apps, and in the next you’d be exploring how open-source foundations are rewriting business models for the AI era. For example, the talk by Maxime Beauchemin titled “Open Source’s Massive Unfair Advantage in the AI Era” laid bare how open communities are sprinting ahead of closed-source vendors.

Attendees from all over the world compared notes on data stack choices. The screens stitched together dozens of micro-conversations about architecture, governance, data observability, and the human side of analytics engineering.

The community walked away with slide decks, yes, but more importantly with a sense of direction: intelligent pipelines, observability at scale, AI-first analytics, and open ecosystems shaping the next wave of value.

And because everything was recorded and available on demand, the ripple continues. Attendees who logged in later, or who live in time zones far from the main sessions, still get to catch the talks. The content lives on, fueling conversations and implementations long after the virtual “lights off”. 

For you, with your passion for community, content and connecting people across borders, OSA CON 2025 offered more than tech depth, it offered storylines. The story of how analytics infrastructures are becoming people-infrastructure; how open source is not just a license model but a network of collaboration; and how talent-rich communities are seeding ideas for textbooks we haven’t yet written.

OSA CON 2025 wasn’t “just another conference”. It was a pulse check on the state of open-source analytics and a kickoff for what comes next.
