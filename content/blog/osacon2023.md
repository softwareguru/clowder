3 days, 43 talks, 53 leaders, practitioners and advocates of over 40 Open Source projects sharing their success, insights, best practices and knowledge with over 2,000 data practitioners from 90+ countries. Here’s a recap of what happened at OSA CON 2023.
The Open Source Analytics Conference (OSA CON) covered a spectrum of projects within the modern data stack, it brought together creators, leaders, active contributors, users, and advocates from various Open Source communities. The goal was to learn, share and explore the latest developments in data ingestion, orchestration, databases, infrastructure, governance, visualization, and AI. In its third year, [Preset](https://preset.io/) collaborated with [Altinity](https://altinity.com/) to host this conference.

With representatives from Confluent, Google, Cloudera, Altinity, Preset, and many others, OSA CON provided a variety of topics - everything from expert points of view in the data world to real-world applications within companies of all sizes, from enterprises to growing startups. 

OSA CON was also successful in more fundamental ways. 

* **Showcasing open source analytic projects.** Starting with Jun Rao presenting on “Reinventing Kafka in the Data Streaming Era” to the final talk by Shirshanka Das on “How to Implement Data Contracts with DataHub,” we saw dozens of innovative and mature tools to understand the flood of data in digital enterprises.

* **Enabling synergy.** Analytic applications run in stacks. The keynotes stressed integration and how to achieve business-altering advances in cost-efficiency. Learning about other projects also helped us to look beyond the narrow corners many of us work in.

* **Sharing new paradigms.** Multiple talks explored how to update the popular [modern data stack](https://www.thoughtspot.com/data-trends/best-practices/modern-data-stack) using API-based tools, open source code, and cloud native operation. OSA CON demonstrated that the open source, modern data stack paradigm is better defined and more mature than many of us knew. 

This conference could not have happened without the great audience, their enthusiasm, support and interest in Open Source Analytics. It’s now time to think about the future. We are looking to go bigger and better for OSA CON 2024. 

There’s also important homework for everyone who attended. OSA CON 2023 showed you how open source can deliver fast, flexible, cost-efficient insight for users. Here is our challenge to every attendee.  Use your new knowledge to create something amazing. Build your next analytic application on open source. Then come back next year and tell us how it went!
If you missed the conference, you can watch the recordings at the YouTube channel. We look forward to seeing you next year!
