KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America took place this November in the City of Chicago to close the year 2023 in the best way. The event managed to gather thousands of enthusiasts under an agenda of Kubernetes and Cloud Native and its different edges: Security, Observability, Service Mesh, Storage, Orchestration, Community, Diversity and Inclusion. 

Precisely, one of the notable keynotes was "United In The Cloud: Where Inclusion 'Winds' Around The World" led by Nikhita Raghunath and with the participation of inclusion representatives from different groups such as Divya Mohan from India, the nation that contributes more to Cloud Native Open Source, Akihiro Suda who received the award for Top Committer by the CNCF; Carolina Valencia, representing the Latino community and Destiny O'Connor, Tech Evangelist who works with deaf people.

In that order of ideas and in the margin of the global community that the CNCF promotes, the Linux Software Foundation awarded scholarships to people from around the world, among which were Kubernetes Community Days organizers who are planning the next KCDs in their respective countries and regions. -KCDs are community-organized events that bring together enthusiasts from Open Source and Cloud Native communities for education, collaboration, networking and community growth-. 

The CNCF provided a space in the KCD kiosk during the conference to promote upcoming events to the community, this dynamic not only allowed KubeCon attendees to know the upcoming dates and venues of the KCDs but also got the organizers to talk about opportunities to work together and make these events more visible around the world. 

In the second half of 2023 the community in Latin America witnessed a surge of KCD events in this region. Clowder Space was involved in the events in Medell√≠n, Guatemala and San Salvador. This trend will continue for 2024, when the first KCD in Mexico, the event will be held next February 23rd and 24th in Guadalajara in co-located format with the Open Source Contributors Summit, a reference event for Open Source in Latin America since 2019. 

The 2024 roadmap also includes the KCD Costa Rica that will take place on March 1st and 2nd, among others that can be found on the CNCF website. This is how this foundation continues to architect futures and motivate the great minds of the world to contribute to Open Source.
