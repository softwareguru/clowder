#### Beam Summit 2024: Riding with Apache Beam at the Google Campus

Did you know that Apache Beam is an open-source, unified model for defining both batch and streaming processing pipeline? The 7th edition of Beam Summit showcased this idea among several use cases regarding the implementation of Apache Beam in different organizations. This 2 day conference at the Google Campus in Sunnyvale, CA helped to grow an amazing community of professionals around the world.

By having the conference at the Google Campus, the experience offered a mix of a vibrant community, prestige, cutting-edge technology, and networking opportunities.  The  attendees could feel a strong innovation and tech presence while attracting participation from open-source involved contributors. This location also permitted easy access for professionals interested in Apache Beam.

On the first day Use cases were explained in order to understand how Beam serves different models focusing on real-time data processing. Also, the hands-on workshops covered topics such as the use of Kafka and Beam for application modernization and how to manage Python pipelines dependencies. 

For Beam Summit day 2, around 20 other sessions were held including workshops. The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning were discussed as well as streaming data engineering. The workshops provided experience in building streaming pipelines with Python and event processing with state and timers. 

**Some attendee’s comments:**

 * “The experience was invaluable—not only did I get to share my insights on bridging Beam and Airflow, but I also had the chance to learn from fellow industry leaders. It was an inspiring week full of cutting-edge discussions!” 
 
 * “Loved hearing about all the innovation in AI and data platforms, especially the cool use cases from Cruise , Uber Engineering , and Project Shield.”

 * “Apache Beam is super useful, good for ML, super flexible, a prime candidate for building these things: RAG, multi-modal, embedding, vector DBs.”

Thanks to all the organizers, speakers, and attendees for making Beam Summit 2024 possible! Everyone’s contribution was key for the success of this insightful conference. Looking forward to next year where more conversations and innovative ideas will be seen!
