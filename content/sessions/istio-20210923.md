For large platforms that support hundreds of projects, it is vital to gain insight into the api response code, api response time, api numbers, while monitoring and precisely alerting. Istio can easily achieve these requirements, without any changes to service code. In addition, troubleshooting in a complex service mesh is always troublesome and time-cost. However, through integration of Istio and jaeger, they can combine client requests, tracing, Istio logs, and application logs altogether. In this way, when a problem occurs with the api, it is easy to locate. In this session, HP devops shared their best practices in cluster observability, hoping to bring useful references for everyone.
