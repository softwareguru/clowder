Coming to Halifax, Nova Scotia, October 7-10, 2023.


This year, Community Over Code will feature four in-person days of sessions at the Halifax Convention Centre, with tracks focusing on Search, Big Data, Internet of Things, Community, Geospatial, Cassandra, Financial Tech, and many other topics. Each evening will also feature Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions, where communities will have an opportunity for free-form discussion and planning around our various projects.

Watch this space for more information about Community Over Code, as the organizers work to put together another informative and collaborative event for the ASF and the broader open source community.
