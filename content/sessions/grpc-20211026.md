In this talk, Viktor Gamov introduced the Kubernetes Ingress and how you can use it in gRPC applications. He talked about the Kong Ingress Controller (KIC), an open-source implementation of the Kubernetes Controller that can be installed and managed precisely as any other Kubernetes resource. You will learn how to easily expose Kubernetes services to the outside world with KIC. During this talk, you will learn about the vast plugin ecosystem of Kong Gateway to declaratively enable security, API rate limiting, and native gRPC support!
