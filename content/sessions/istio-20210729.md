When your services are deployed on hundreds of kubernetes clusters, app engine and other deployment platforms, ensuring the progressive speed, resilience and observability of the infrastructure becomes a nightmare for an SRE team. Radical adoption of different tools to create gateway setups  for each of these infrastructures, makes things more complicated and painful to maintain in the long run. This talk describes how we created a HyperMesh using Istio, that connects this kind of distributed infrastructural nodes from a single point, with distributed responsibility across teams and  a central point of control by the SRE.
