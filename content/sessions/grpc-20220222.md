GRPC framework designed by Google which is an extended version of RPC Framework. Remote Procedure Call (RPC) are special services that are executed over the network. GRPC pros:
1. GRPC are secure because behind the GRPC is the http2 protocol.
2. GRPC sends a stream of data over the network in the form of binary message rather than text. 
3. GRPC utilizes ProtocolBuffer schema which reduces latency rate, bandwidth consumption, binary message and special services that easily integrate with other languages which provide support for protos.
