As a long time practitioner building out large scale data pipelines across very applications I was excited to join the Beam to team help continue to push the boundary of data pipeline software. In this talk I'll discuss what motivated me to join the Beam team and where I think the model is especially useful to data practitioners (data engineering, machine learning, analysts, etc) and some thoughts around how we can use these concepts to build more scalable and manageable data pipelines.
