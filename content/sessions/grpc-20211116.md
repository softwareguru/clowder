gRPC is a modern open source high performance RPC framework providing advanced features such as authentication, service mesh support, and streaming. Dataproc Metastore (DPMS) on GCP is integrating Hive Metastore with gRPC as an access path in addition to Thrift. In this talk Zhou Fang introduced the design of gRPC integration, and how it enables new DPMS features such as Cloud Run endpoint, find-grained IAM, and metastore federation.
