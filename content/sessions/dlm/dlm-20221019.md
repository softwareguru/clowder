Apache Iceberg: An architectural look under the covers
Demo description: In this talk, we will introduce Apache Iceberg, go through its architecture/design benefits and discuss how it addresses some of the critical problems with the existing table format, Hive. Ultimately, we will talk about how you can manage & organize all of your data in the data lake using Iceberg & serve use cases such as BI.
