Originated from UC Berkeley AMPLab, Alluxio foresaw the need for agility when accessing data across silos separated from compute engines like Spark, Presto, Tensorflow and PyTorch. Embracing the separation of storage from compute engines. It simplifies adoption of the data lake and data mesh paradigm for analytics and AI/ML. In this talk, Bin Fan will provide an overview of the Alluxio Open Source project, and share observations to help identify ways to use the platform to meet the needs of your data environment and workloads.
