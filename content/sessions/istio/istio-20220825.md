Setting up and then preserving a multi-cluster Istio mesh is cumbersome today, as it involves several manual steps. Those steps are not automatic, because there is no continuous synchronization mechanism between the participating clusters.

I'll show an almost fully automated solution that can form and then sustain a multi-cluster Istio mesh using:

* An open-source Istio operator, and a cluster registry controller component, which provides continuous synchronization for the necessary resources between the clusters.   

In this session, you will learn:  

* How to form a multi-cluster mesh with ease  
* How the necessary resources are synced between the clusters  
* How the system recovers even when network endpoints are changed
