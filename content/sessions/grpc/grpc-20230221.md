Configuration changes are at the heart of any software operations. `protoconf`, which is heavily inspired by Meta's `Configerator` tool, is designed to rethink how configuration is being Composed, Delivered and Consumed by software in the fastest and safest way.

In this session we will go over an overview of protoconf's architecture and will focus on how gRPC and protobuf are used to consume and programmatically alter configurations.
