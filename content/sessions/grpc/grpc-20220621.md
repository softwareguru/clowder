Kubernetes introduces the native support of gRPC probes for health and readiness checks. Many Kubernetes users who used to run gRPC services on Kubernetes will be able to migrate to those probes from ones currently used. New built-in probes have limitations that will be described in this talk. Also the talk will cover potential future improvements. As Kubernetes maintainers are looking at making gRPC probes support GA soon, this section is a way to gather more feedback from practitioners.
