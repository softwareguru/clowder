At Platogo, to enable us to handle high volumes of events from our social game apps, we built out our infrastructure in a cloud-native, microservice way. This means that we can mix different stacks, and have parallel development of services, and have them communicate over gRPC or custom TCP-based protocols. Daniils Petrovs, server teamâ€™s backend engineer, will show how we moved out core Ruby functionality into a separate Elixir-based umbrella app using gRPC, how this enabled us to develop faster, and what new changes happened to gRPC in the Erlang/Elixir area.
