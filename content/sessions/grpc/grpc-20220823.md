Ballerina is an open-source programming language that mainly focuses on building cloud-native applications. Ballerina offers network primitives in the language to simplify developing and deploying services in the cloud, making it easier to use, combine, and create network services. Services with resource and remote functions, clients, and interactions are higher-level concepts in the language designed to hide the complexities of working over the network. In this demo, I will talk about the Ballerina language, the gRPC support in Ballerina Language, and show how easy to write a gRPC service and client application in Ballerina.
