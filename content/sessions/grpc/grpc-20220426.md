Lightbend has built out its new Platform as a Service (PaaS) to be gRPC centric, enabling development teams to build real-time data applications and microservices in whatever language they choose, using either gRPC APIs or idiomatic SDKs. But we also leverage gRPC internally as well, in the product, to facilitate the inner workings of the platform itself. In this demo and presentation, Jeremy Pollock, VP of Product & Developer Platforms, will step through just how the product uses gRPC and how it makes it easier for developers out there in the wild to build gRPC services for their own use.
