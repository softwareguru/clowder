The flexibility of modern cloud infrastructures and the rise of serverless brought event-driven service integrations back into fashion. Knative made it possible to leverage common messaging patterns the Cloud Native way, and build complex systems where components communicate asynchronously on top of Kubernetes. But building such systems requires some intrinsic knowledge of the Kubernetes API, and a good understanding of Knative's loosely coupled building blocks. 

In this demo, Antoine Cotten showcased how TriggerMesh leveraged the HCL syntax and some basic graph theory to design a description language specifically tailored for expressing event-driven architectures for service integrations backed by Knative, using common messaging patterns.
