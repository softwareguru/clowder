Using Knative as a member of the community allows me to get more hands on with the awesome tech we're producing as well closer to the end users we're building for.

My team at VMware is distributed across many countries and it was hard to be aware of all the holidays that would be coming up. I built an Knative Service + Eventing + Func application that solves the simple internal problem by sending a weekly slack message reminding us of the upcoming holidays for the next month.

I find dogfooding as a powerful way of engaging with our contributor community and and building empathy for our end user community.
