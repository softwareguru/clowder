In this session, Maciej explained  through an approach that allows to rely on serverless techniques such as functions and cloud events yet still working on the higher-level representation. He introduced Workflow as a Function Flow concept that builds up on top of state of the art technologies such as CloudEvents and Knative Eventing to deliver a highly scalable business-oriented solution that looks like a single service but runs as a set of functions.
