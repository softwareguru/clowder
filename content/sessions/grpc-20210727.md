gRPC comes loaded with benefits including portability, speed, and efficiency, yet the configuration of the mandatory proxy for translating between gRPC-Web requests and HTTP/2.0 in the browser is still a major pain point for many. During this presentation Casey Wylie  covered a deep dive of how to configure Istio to support your gRPC web applications that consume streams. At the end, he showed the application from the presentation and linked it to the Open Source repo.
