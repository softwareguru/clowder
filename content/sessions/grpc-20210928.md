In this talk, Enrique Zamudio “Chochos” briefly explained a homegrown implementation about how it works to replace a solution with gRPC, considering the cost of migrating, and how much we can reuse. He showed some diagrams and a simple example of a microservice along with some challenges with sharing API server access across different clusters.
