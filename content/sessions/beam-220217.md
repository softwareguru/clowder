Code reusability is one of the most important things when you are programming. With that in mind, we have created a unified Apache Beam core that handles many of the different use cases a Data engineer face daily. On this occasion, we will present different real-life use cases of Apache Beam for bounded and unbounded data sources about how to parse JSON data with almost 0 coding experience.
