The Future of Microbial Genomics with Apache Airflow- In recent years, the bioinformatics world has seen an explosion in genomic analysis as gene sequencing technologies have become exponentially cheaper. Tests that previously would have cost tens of thousands of dollars will soon run at pennies per sequence. This glut of data has exposed a notable bottleneck in the current suite of technologies available to bioinformaticians. At Drift Biotechnologies, we use Apache Airflow to transition traditionally on-premise large scale data and deep learning workflows for bioinformatics to the cloud, with an emphasis on workflows and data from next generation sequencing technologies.
