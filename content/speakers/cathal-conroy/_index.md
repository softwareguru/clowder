Irish engineer working with Workday in Dublin, Ireland. Over his three years with the Public Cloud team, he has helped to orchestrate and maintain the Workday platform over many regions throughout the world. More recently, he has been one of three engineers tasked with onboarding Workday and its hundreds of services to Istio Service Mesh. This proved to be a multi-year journey, filled with many ups and downs much like any enterprise-scale migration.
