Krisztian Fekete is enthusiastic about observability and cloud infrastructures. He's working at LastPass as senior DevOps/SRE engineer and building a self hosted blog on top of Istio in his spare time. The main topics of the blog are aligned with his interests while he is also using the platform to share operational details on running one of the most "over-engineered" blog out there.
