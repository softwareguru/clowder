My name is Ferran Fernandez. I'm a Senior Data Engineer at Chartboost. Highly passionate about Data, with +5 years of professional experience having worked on large distributed systems with bast amount of data load. Always eager to learn new things. I love traveling even though I haven't had the chance lately because of the current situation.
