Twenty plus year product leader with extensive experience in developer-focused platforms. Prior to joining Lightbend, Jeremy led the product organization at real time communication platform leader, PubNub, and before that, he helped build up API management pioneer, Mashery, ultimately leading the product during the post acquisition Intel and TIBCO years. While a long time PM, Jeremy is a developer at heart and uses this passion to build platforms that empower other developers. His combination of tech and communication skills probably comes from his college experience: B.S. Chemical Engineering and B.A English, both from the University of Notre Dame.
